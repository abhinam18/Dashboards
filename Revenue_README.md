## Key Metrics and DAX Examples

1. **Revenue vs. Marketing Spend Ratio**:
   - DAX Example: `SpendRatio = DIVIDE(SUM(Revenue[Marketing Spend]), SUM(Revenue[Total Revenue]))`

2. **Segment Revenue vs. Target**:
   - DAX Example: `RevenueTargetDiff = SUM(Revenue[Actual Revenue]) - SUM(Revenue[Target Revenue])`

3. **Industry-Level Revenue**:
   - DAX Example: `IndustryRevenue = SUMMARIZE(Revenue, Revenue[Industry], "TotalRevenue", SUM(Revenue[Revenue]))`

4. **Category-Wise Revenue**:
   - DAX Example: `CategoryRevenue = SUMMARIZE(Revenue, Revenue[Category], "CategorySales", SUM(Revenue[Sales]))`
